    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="hero-description">
      These spicy turkey legs are sweet and hotâ€”just like the smoked turkey legs
      you get at the fair or theme park!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 (2 liter) bottle <em>lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage</em>
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons <em>sugar</em></li>
      <li>2 tablespoons <em>hot sauce</em></li>
      <li>1 tablespoon <em>crushed red pepper flakes</em></li>
      <li>1 tablespoon <em>black pepper</em></li>
      <li>1 large <em>sweet onion, sliced</em></li>
      <li>4 <em>turkey legs</em></li>
      <li>2 tablespoons <em>honey</em></li>
      <li>1 tablespoon <em>steak seasoning</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, mix the lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage, sugar,
        hot sauce, red pepper, pepper, and onion. Place the turkey legs in the
        mixture, and bring to a boil. Cook 30 to 45 minutes, until the turkey
        has reached an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove onion slices from the mixture, and arrange on the prepared grill.
        Place turkey legs over the onions. Drizzle with honey, and season with
        steak seasoning. Cook, tuning once, 20 minutes, or until a crisp browned
        crust has formed on the turkey legs.
      </li>
    </ol>
