    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="hero-description">
      Deep-fried Oreos are a carnival favorite where I grew up. Oreos get dipped
      into pancake batter and fried â€” yummy! You can do this with or without a
      deep fryer.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 quarts of <em>vegetable oil</em> for frying</li>
      <li>1 cup <em>milk</em></li>
      <li>1 large <em>egg</em></li>
      <li>2 teaspoons <em>vegetable oil</em></li>
      <li>1 cup <em>pancake mix</em></li>
      <li>
        1 (18 ounce) package cream-filled chocolate
        <em>sandwich cookies</em> (such as Oreo)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk milk, egg, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large bowl until
        smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip cookies into batter, one at a time, and carefully place into hot
        oil. Fry in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until cookies are golden brown,
        about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
