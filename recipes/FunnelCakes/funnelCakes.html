    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="hero-description">
      A funnel cake is a popular dessert made by frying batter. Commonly served
      at carnivals and amusement parks, funnel cakes (as we know them today)
      originated in Pennsylvania in the late 1800s. The fried dessert is
      liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar before serving.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart <em>vegetable oil</em> for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups <em>milk</em></li>
      <li>2 large <em>eggs</em></li>
      <li>2 cups <em>all-purpose flour</em></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <em>baking powder</em></li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon <em>ground cinnamon</em></li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon <em>salt</em></li>
      <li>3/4 cup <em>confectioner's sugar</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a heavy skillet.</li>
      <li>
        Beat milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine flour, baking
        powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture
        until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use your finger to cover the funnel hole; pour in 1 cup of batter.
        Starting in the center of the skillet, remove your finger and move the
        funnel in a swirling motion to make a 6- or 7-inch round. <br />
        Fry in hot oil until bottom is golden brown; flip and continue cooking
        until golden brown all over, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper
        towels. Continue cooking remaining batter.
